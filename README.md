### Hi there, I'm Takahashi ðŸ‘‹
It's so nice to meet you. I was working in an automobile industryðŸš— as a sales representative and helping developers for three years after I graduated from an English course at Kyoto Sangyo University in 2018. At that time, I realized heaps of workers faced tons of inefficient old-fashion tasksðŸ§» and should benefit from IT helping to work efficiency and standardization of work. That's the reason why I've decided to engage in an IT industry as an engineer, "not a sales". To achieve the goal, I learnt basic usage of Rails, Ruby on Rails, JS and HTML/CSS at DMM Webcamp Commit for four months from November in 2021. In addition, I've been studying them and also some related languages like SQL by myself. The essence of my goal is to make people happy, yay!
